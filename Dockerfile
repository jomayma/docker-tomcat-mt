### Containers should NOT run as root as a good practice

#The EXPOSE instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.
EXPOSE 8080

# The CMD instruction specifies what to run when the container (not the image) is run.
# In our case, TomCat server is started by running the shell script that starts the web container.
# There can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile.
# Donâ€™t confuse RUN with CMD. RUN actually runs a command at build time.
