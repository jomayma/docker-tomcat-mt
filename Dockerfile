# Adding the sample webapp and placing it in the folder /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ on the container.
# According to the Tomcat documentation, the War should be placed under CATALINA_BASE/webapps.
# From the Tomcat image documentation, we know that the default path CATALINA_BASE corresponds to /usr/local/tomcat on the container.
# The War file will be automatically expanded and deployed.

#The EXPOSE instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.

# The CMD instruction specifies what to run when the container (not the image) is run.
# In our case, TomCat server is started by running the shell script that starts the web container.
# There can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile.
# Donâ€™t confuse RUN with CMD. RUN actually runs a command at build time.
